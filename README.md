Matlab Code of numerical examples for the computation of finite-time coherent sets : R. M. Polzin, "Reduced stochastic modeling of atmospheric processes on different scales", 3rd Chapter, 2024.

The code uses the Matlab-based software package GAIO described in: Michael Dellnitz, Gary Froyland, and Oliver Junge. "The algorithms behind GAIO—Set oriented numerical methods for dynamical systems." In Ergodic theory, analysis, and efficient simulation of dynamical systems, pages 145–174. Springer, 2001.
